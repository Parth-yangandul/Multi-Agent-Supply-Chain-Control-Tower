Inventory agent identified need for 120-unit reorder as current stock (85) is below reorder point and existing PO from Budget Supplies is both delayed (12-day ETA) and from a low-reliability supplier (72%). Risk agent flagged HIGH risk in both supplier and logistics dimensions. To mitigate compounding risks, the system recommends switching to Reliable Corp (95% reliability, 5-day standard lead) and expediting the shipment. This dual-supplier strategy ensures coverage: if Budget Supplies delivers late or fails, Reliable Corp's expedited order provides backup. The logistics agent supported expediting due to converging risk factors. Coordinator prioritized supply chain resilience over cost optimization in this scenario."
